        'The Quran began to be revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the Cave of Hira during Ramadan.',
      details: `**Beginning of Revelation**  

The revelation of the Quran began when Angel Jibreel (Gabriel) appeared to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the Cave of Hira. This momentous event took place in the month of **Ramadan**, during one of his spiritual retreats in the cave, where he would spend time in deep reflection and meditation.  

### **The First Revelation**  
The Angel Jibreel commanded the Prophet to **"Read" (Iqra)**, but being unlettered, he responded, **"I am not a reader."** This happened three times before the angel revealed the first verses of the Quran:  

> _Read in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clinging substance. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous—Who taught by the pen—Taught man that which he knew not._  
> **(Quran 96:1-5)**  

This was the first step in the divine mission that would continue for **23 years**, bringing guidance to humanity.  

### **Prophet Muhammad's Reaction**  
After the revelation, the Prophet (PBUH) felt overwhelmed and rushed back home, trembling. He sought comfort from his wife, **Khadijah (RA)**, saying:  
_"Cover me! Cover me!"_  

She consoled him and took him to her cousin, **Waraqah ibn Nawfal**, a Christian scholar who confirmed that this was indeed a revelation from Allah, similar to what had come to previous prophets.  

### **Significance of the Event**  
1. **Beginning of Prophethood** – This marked the start of Muhammad’s mission as the last messenger of Allah.  
2. **Divine Guidance** – The Quran was revealed gradually over **23 years**, shaping the lives of millions.  
3. **A Life-Changing Moment** – The Prophet (PBUH) transformed from a simple merchant into the final prophet, guiding humanity with Allah’s message.  

This event remains one of the most significant moments in Islamic history, commemorated every year in Ramadan, particularly in **Laylatul Qadr (The Night of Decree).**
